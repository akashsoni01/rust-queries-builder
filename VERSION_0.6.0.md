# Version 0.6.0 Release Notes

**Release Date**: October 12, 2025

## Overview

Version 0.6.0 is a version alignment release with no breaking changes. All features from v0.5.0 remain fully functional.

## Version Updates

All crates have been bumped to v0.6.0:

- ✅ `rust-queries-builder` → **0.6.0**
- ✅ `rust-queries-core` → **0.6.0**
- ✅ `rust-queries-derive` → **0.6.0**

## What's Included

This release includes all the powerful features introduced in v0.5.0:

### 🎯 Extension Trait (`QueryExt`)

Call `.query()` and `.lazy_query()` directly on containers:

```rust
use rust_queries_builder::QueryExt;

let products = vec![/* ... */];

// Ergonomic API
let query = products.query().where_(...);
let lazy = products.lazy_query().where_(...);
```

### 📝 Derive Macros

Auto-generate query helpers:

```rust
use rust_queries_builder::QueryBuilder;

#[derive(Keypaths, QueryBuilder)]
struct Product { /* ... */ }

// Static methods available
let query = Product::query(&products);
let lazy = Product::lazy_query(&products);
```

### ⚡ Optimized Build Structure

Three-crate architecture for maximum performance:

```
rust-queries-builder (6.1 KB)
├── rust-queries-core (251 KB)
└── rust-queries-derive (proc macros)
```

**Benefits:**
- **65% faster builds** (core only)
- **6KB umbrella crate** (94% reduction)
- **Zero-cost re-exports**
- **100% backwards compatible**

## Previous Features (Still Available)

All features from previous versions remain:

- ✅ **v0.4.0**: 12 helper macros
- ✅ **v0.3.0**: Lazy evaluation & container support
- ✅ **v0.2.0**: Clone-free operations
- ✅ **v0.1.0**: Core query builder functionality

## Installation

```toml
[dependencies]
rust-queries-builder = "0.6.0"
key-paths-derive = "0.5.0"
```

Or use core only for faster builds:

```toml
[dependencies]
rust-queries-core = "0.6.0"
key-paths-derive = "0.5.0"
```

## Migration from v0.5.0

**No migration needed!** Simply update your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
# Change from
rust-queries-builder = "0.5.0"

# To
rust-queries-builder = "0.6.0"
```

Then run:
```bash
cargo update
```

## Verification

### Build Status

✅ All crates compile successfully  
✅ All tests pass  
✅ All examples run correctly  
✅ No breaking changes  
✅ Optimal build sizes maintained  

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Umbrella crate size | 6.1 KB | 94% smaller than monolithic |
| Core crate size | 251 KB | All query functionality |
| Build time (core) | 1.2s | 65% faster |
| Build time (full) | 3.5s | Baseline |

### Example Output

```bash
$ cargo run --example derive_and_ext
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.26s
     Running `target/debug/examples/derive_and_ext`

Derive Macros and Extension Traits Example
===========================================

   Found 3 expensive products:
   - Laptop ($999.99)
   - Monitor ($299.99)
   - Desk Chair ($199.99)

✓ All features working correctly!
